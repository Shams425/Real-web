                      <p>
                        Food borne disease is a serious problem that causes
                        illness and death in some cases in every country in the
                        world.
                        <br />
                        Importantly, most cases of food borne disease can be
                        prevented, and there are simple steps that can be taken
                        to reduce the risks and make food safer.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Food borne disease is caused by consuming contaminated
                        food, drinks or water.
                      </p>
                      <h3 class="title">Who is at risk?</h3>
                      <p>
                        All people are at risk from food borne diseases.
                        However, there are certain people who are at greater
                        risk. These include young children, the elderly,
                        pregnant women and people who have weak immune systems
                        due to illness.
                      </p>
                      <h3 class="title">What are the effects?</h3>
                      <p>
                        Food borne disease can cause a wide range of symptoms,
                        including vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and headache. It
                        can happen within hours of eating contaminated food, or

                        Microbiological hazards such as bacteria and viruses are
                        the major cause of food safety problems in most of the
                        food industry. The causes and prevention of these
                        hazards is therefore the focus of this book.

                        increases the risk of food borne disease. <br />

                      <p>
                        Viruses are organisms that are much smaller than
                        bacteria. They cause many outbreaks of food borne
                        disease. <br />
                        A typical virus (e.g. Norovirus) usually causes symptoms
                        such as diarrhoea and vomiting within 2 days of eating
                        contaminated food. Illness can last 7 days or more

                      <p>
                        People can become infected with viruses in several ways,
                        including:
                      </p>
                      <ul style="list-style: disc">
                        <li>Consuming contaminated food or drink,</li>
                        <li>
                          Touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then
                          touching their mouths
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Having direct contact with someone who is infected and
                          showing symptoms.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        Because viruses are so small, they can contaminate food
                        and drink very easily. The slightest contact with
                        contaminated hands or surfaces can spread a virus.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Viruses are extremely contagious and spread very
                        quickly, especially through ‘closed’ environments such
                        as cruise ships, schools and hospitals. <br />
                        <br />
                        Therefore, to reduce the risk of spreading viruses, it
                        is essential for food handlers to be ‘fit for work’ (see
                        page 8 for details), and to follow strict personal
                        hygiene and hand washing practices at all times. <br />

                        Food itself can be a source of contamination. In
                        particular, raw foods such as meat, poultry, fish and
                        eggs are often contaminated with large numbers of
                        bacteria that can easily spread to other food. This is a
                        particular risk for ‘high risk’ foods (see page 11).

                        Different types of food must be kept separate at all

                        preparation, display, etc. For example, raw food and
                        ‘high risk’ food should ideally be kept in separate cold
                        storage equipment. <br /><br />
                        In situations where these foods must be stored in the

                        meat and poultry should be kept separately on the bottom

                          There are some types of food that are at greater risk
                          than others. These are called ‘high risk’ food and
                          need to be treated with extra care at all stages, from
                          purchase and storage to preparation and service
                          <br /><br />
                          Examples of ‘high risk’ food include: cold cooked
                          meats and seafood, sandwiches, salads, cream desserts,
                          hummus, and mayonnaise.

                          Bacteria grow quickly and easily on these kinds of
                          food. They are also ‘ready-to-eat’ food, which means
                          they will not be cooked at a later stage (i.e. before
                          they are eaten), so there is no opportunity to kill
                          the bacteria.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          ‘High risk’ foods such as salads and sandwiches must
                          be kept cold, but they are often brought out of cold
                          storage so that they can be prepared or displayed to
                          customers. There is also often a lot of handling
                          involved during preparation.

                          All of these factors make these types of food very
                          likely to cause food borne disease if they are not

                          There are some types of food that are at greater risk
                          than others. These are called ‘high risk’ food and
                          need to be treated with extra care at all stages, from
                          purchase and storage to preparation and service
                          <br /><br />
                          Examples of ‘high risk’ food include: cold cooked
                          meats and seafood, sandwiches, salads, cream desserts,
                          hummus, and mayonnaise.

                          Bacteria grow quickly and easily on these kinds of
                          food. They are also ‘ready-to-eat’ food, which means
                          they will not be cooked at a later stage (i.e. before
                          they are eaten), so there is no opportunity to kill
                          the bacteria.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          ‘High risk’ foods such as salads and sandwiches must
                          be kept cold, but they are often brought out of cold
                          storage so that they can be prepared or displayed to
                          customers. There is also often a lot of handling
                          involved during preparation.

                          All of these factors make these types of food very
                          likely to cause food borne disease if they are not
                          treated with care at all stages.

                      <p>
                        Hands are one of the most common sources of cross
                        contamination in food production areas. Hands can become
                        contaminated with bacteria from a wide variety of
                        sources and spread them quickly and easily <br />
                        The three most important times for hands to be washed
                        thoroughly are:

                          or going to the toilet),

                          Before preparing ‘high risk’ ready-to-eat food (see

                        </li>

                        Food itself can be a source of contamination. In
                        particular, raw foods such as meat, poultry, fish and
                        eggs are often contaminated with large numbers of
                        bacteria that can easily spread to other food. This is a
                        particular risk for ‘high risk’ foods (see page 11).
                      </p>

                        Different types of food must be kept separate at all
                        times: during delivery, unloading, storage, defrosting,
                        preparation, display, etc. For example, raw food and
                        ‘high risk’ food should ideally be kept in separate cold
                        storage equipment. <br /><br />
                        In situations where these foods must be stored in the
                        same equipment (e.g. a ‘general purpose’ fridge) the raw
                        meat and poultry should be kept separately on the bottom
                        shelf. All foods should also be safely covered during
                        storage.
